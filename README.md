# NingmengBot - Experimental Chatting System

## Core Module

### Link Shortener?

For CloudMusic.    
Rich preview tagging [Example](https://neko.ayaka.moe/tests/ogptest)     
↑↑↑ This site only contains the necessary meta tags for [OGP](http://ogp.me/) (Why it's not HTTPS), view the source code instead.     

### Basic Fun-Chat

Replies with stickers or some funny messages.    
(How to impliment it? :thinking:)

### NLP (May or may not)

Thanks to @zhangyubaka for NLP resouce.

This project will use [NodeJieba](https://github.com/yanyiwu/nodejieba).

## Plugin System


Whatever just copy the moeBot code.

Poor Neko decided to write some fun plugins first.
